    description:
      "Ceramic coating is a liquid polymer made from nanotechnology-based SiOâ‚‚ (silicon dioxide). Once cured, it chemically bonds to the factory paint (or any other surface it's applied to), creating a hydrophobic, slick, and ultra-durable shield. Unlike traditional waxes or sealants, ceramic coatings provide a long-lasting, hydrophobic surface that repels dirt, water, road grime, bird droppings, bug splatter, and more. The coating's molecular structure forms a tight, glass-like layer that offers UV resistance, scratch protection, chemical resistance, and enhanced gloss. Available in three levels of protection: Level 1 (2 years/30,000 km), Level 2 (4 years/60,000 km), and Level 3 (5 years/100,000 km).",
